# GoDaddy DNS Fix for Replit Custom Domain

## Current DNS Records
```
a  @     15.197.142.173  (Can't delete - GoDaddy default)
a  @     3.33.152.147    (Can't delete - GoDaddy default) 
a  @     34.111.179.208  (CAN DELETE - this one!)
a  www   34.111.179.208  (KEEP - this works for www.elpdata.com)
```

## Solution: Configure Only Apex Domain

### Step 1: Delete Conflicting A Record
**Delete this one A record:**
- Type: A, Name: @, Data: 34.111.179.208

### Step 2: Keep www A Record
**DO NOT touch this record:**
- Type: A, Name: www, Data: 34.111.179.208 (keeps www.elpdata.com working)

### Step 3: Configure Only elpdata.com in Replit
In Replit custom domain settings:
- **Add only**: `elpdata.com` (apex domain)
- **Do NOT add**: `www.elpdata.com` (already working)

## Why This Works
- Removes the conflicting third A record for "@"
- Keeps www.elpdata.com working with existing A record
- Only configures apex domain in Replit to avoid the "multiple A records" error
- www.elpdata.com continues working normally

## Expected Result
- ✅ https://www.elpdata.com (continues working)
- ✅ https://elpdata.com (will work after Replit SSL)
- Both domains properly configured with SSL
