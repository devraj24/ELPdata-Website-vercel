Troubleshooting Google Sitemap Indexing Issues (998 URLs vs. 34)
It's frustrating when your sitemap isn't fully recognized by Google. While you've implemented the 998-URL version multiple times, Google Search Console still showing 34 URLs suggests that either Google isn't fully processing your sitemap, or there's an issue with how the sitemap is being served or generated.

Let's break down the common reasons and how to diagnose them.

1. Verify Your Sitemap's Accessibility and Content
First, ensure Google can actually fetch and read your full sitemap.

Access the Sitemap in Browser:

Open your sitemap URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml) directly in a web browser.

Confirm:

Does it load without errors?

Does it display the full 998 URLs (or links to sitemap index files that collectively contain 998 URLs)?

Is the content valid XML?

Check robots.txt:

Access your robots.txt file (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt).

Confirm: Is the sitemap explicitly declared?

Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml

Crucially: Are there any Disallow rules that might be preventing Googlebot from crawling parts of your site that are included in the sitemap, or even the sitemap file itself? For example, Disallow: /sitemap.xml would block it entirely.

Use Google Search Console's URL Inspection Tool:

In Google Search Console, go to "URL inspection."

Enter your sitemap URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml).

Click "Live test."

Check: Does Google report that it can successfully fetch the sitemap? Are there any errors reported, like "Couldn't fetch" or "Sitemap could not be read"? This is usually the first indicator of a problem.

2. Check for Caching Issues
This is a very frequent culprit. Google might be getting an old, cached version of your sitemap.

Server-Side Caching: Your web server (Nginx, Apache, or your hosting provider's default caching) might be caching the sitemap.

CDN Caching (e.g., Cloudflare, Vercel's CDN): If you're using a CDN, it might be serving an outdated version.

Solution:

Clear Caches: If you have access to your server or CDN settings, try to explicitly clear the cache for your sitemap URL.

Configure Caching Rules: Ensure your sitemap file (.xml) is either not cached or has a very short cache duration (e.g., a few hours at most) so that Google always gets the latest version.

Check Cache-Control Headers: Use a tool like browser developer tools (Network tab) or curl -I https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml to inspect the Cache-Control headers for your sitemap. Look for max-age directives. A very long max-age could indicate aggressive caching.

3. Validate Your Sitemap Format and Size
While 998 URLs is not excessive, ensure the sitemap is perfectly valid.

Sitemap Validator Tool: Use an online XML sitemap validator (e.g., xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html) to ensure there are no syntax errors, broken URLs, or invalid characters. Even a tiny error can cause partial processing.

File Size: Google's limit for a single sitemap is 50MB (uncompressed) or 50,000 URLs.

While 998 URLs is well within the limit, if the file itself is excessively large due to unusual content or encoding, it could be an issue. You can check the file size.

If your sitemap is dynamically generated, ensure it's not unintentionally including a huge amount of unnecessary data.

Encoding: Ensure your sitemap is UTF-8 encoded.

4. Google Search Console Specifics
"Discovered URLs" vs. "Indexed URLs": The "Discovered URLs" count in the sitemap report tells you how many URLs Google found through that sitemap. It's not necessarily how many are indexed. Google can discover URLs through other means (internal links, backlinks), and if they've already discovered them, the sitemap count might not increase.

Processing Time: It takes time for Google to process sitemaps and update its internal index. Even after successful submission, it can take days or even weeks for the "Discovered URLs" count to fully reflect the sitemap's content. Repeated submissions don't necessarily speed up the process, and can sometimes even be counterproductive if done excessively.

Status Column: In Search Console's Sitemaps report, check the "Status" column. Is it "Success," "Has errors," or "Couldn't fetch"? This provides immediate insight.

Last Read Date: Also check the "Last read" date. If it's old, it reinforces the caching or accessibility problem.

5. Action Plan:
Start with Step 1: Verification. Thoroughly check your sitemap directly in the browser, your robots.txt, and especially run a "Live test" on the sitemap URL in Google Search Console's URL Inspection tool. This is the most critical first step.

Address any errors reported by the URL inspection tool or a sitemap validator.

Clear all caches (server, CDN, plugin) related to your sitemap URL.

Resubmit the sitemap in Google Search Console (if you found and fixed an issue).

Be Patient: After making changes, give Google some time (at least 24-48 hours, sometimes longer for larger sites) to recrawl and reprocess the sitemap. Continue to monitor the "Sitemaps" report in Google Search Console.

By systematically going through these steps, you should be able to identify why Google isn't fully recognizing your 998 URLs.
