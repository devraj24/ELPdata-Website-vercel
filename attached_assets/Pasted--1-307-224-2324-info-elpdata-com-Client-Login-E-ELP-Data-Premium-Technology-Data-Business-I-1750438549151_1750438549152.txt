Our Story
Founded in 2008, ELP Data emerged from a simple yet powerful vision: to democratize access to high-quality business intelligence. What started as a small team of data enthusiasts has grown into a global leader in B2B data solutions, serving organizations from startups to Fortune 500 companies.

Our journey began when our founders recognized the critical gap between the data businesses needed and what was actually available in the market. Traditional data providers offered outdated, inaccurate information that led to wasted marketing spend and missed opportunities.

Today, we maintain one of the world's most comprehensive and accurate B2B databases, covering over 50 million business contacts across 195+ countries. Our commitment to data quality, innovation, and customer success continues to drive everything we do.
