# Google Search Console Domain Verification Guide

## ✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Status**: Domain verification successful via DNS domain name provider method
**Domain**: elpdata.com  
**Method**: DNS TXT Record Verification

### Step 1: Start Domain Verification in Google Search Console
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click "Add Property" or "+" button
3. **IMPORTANT: You'll see TWO options:**
   - **"Domain"** ← SELECT THIS ONE
   - "URL prefix" ← Don't use this
4. Under the "Domain" option, enter: `elpdata.com`
5. Click "Continue"

**Visual Guide:**
```
Select a property type:

Domain                    URL prefix
[elpdata.com        ]    [https://www.example.com]
Any URL under this       Only URLs with this exact
domain and subdomain     prefix
                         
[CONTINUE]               [CONTINUE]
```

**Choose "Domain" because:**
- It verifies the entire domain (elpdata.com, www.elpdata.com, any subdomain)
- Gives you the DNS TXT record verification method
- More comprehensive than URL prefix

### Step 2: Google Will Provide a TXT Record
After clicking "Continue" with Domain verification, you should see:

**If you see the TXT record:**
```
Verify ownership via DNS record

Copy the TXT record below and add it to the DNS configuration for elpdata.com

TXT record:
google-site-verification=abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yzab567cde890fgh
```

**If you don't see the DNS TXT record, try these steps:**

1. **Make sure you selected "Domain" (not "URL prefix")**
   - Go back and click "Domain" on the left side
   - Enter just `elpdata.com` (no www, no https://)

2. **If still not showing DNS option:**
   - Try entering the domain without www: `elpdata.com`
   - Make sure there are no spaces or extra characters
   - The domain should be exactly: `elpdata.com`

3. **Alternative approach:**
   - Sometimes Google shows multiple verification methods
   - Look for "Verify via DNS record" or "DNS record" option
   - Click "Alternative methods" if you see it

4. **Browser issues:**
   - Try a different browser or incognito mode
   - Clear browser cache and try again

### Step 3: Add TXT Record to Your DNS
Since your domain is `elpdata.com`, you need to add this TXT record to your domain's DNS settings:

**If using GoDaddy:**
1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" → "DNS"
3. Find your domain `elpdata.com`
4. Click "Manage DNS"
5. Add new record:
   - Type: TXT
   - Name: @ (or leave blank)
   - Value: [paste the verification string from Google]
   - TTL: 1 hour

**If using Cloudflare:**
1. Log into Cloudflare
2. Select your domain `elpdata.com`
3. Go to "DNS" → "Records"
4. Click "Add record"
5. Set:
   - Type: TXT
   - Name: @ (or elpdata.com)
   - Content: [paste the verification string from Google]
   - TTL: Auto

**If using other DNS providers:**
- Look for "DNS Management" or "DNS Records"
- Add a TXT record with name "@" or your domain name
- Paste Google's verification string as the value

### Step 4: Verify in Google Search Console
1. After adding the DNS record, wait 5-15 minutes
2. Return to Google Search Console
3. Click "Verify"
4. If successful, you'll see "Ownership verified"

### Benefits of Domain Verification
- Verifies the entire domain (elpdata.com, www.elpdata.com, subdomain.elpdata.com)
- More reliable than HTML file verification
- Works regardless of hosting changes
- No technical routing issues

### Troubleshooting
- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate
- Use online DNS checkers to verify TXT record is live
- Make sure there are no conflicting TXT records
- Contact your domain registrar if you can't find DNS settings

### Current Domain Setup
- Domain: elpdata.com
